Young possums can often be found on the ground close to a nest in a nearby tree. Watch the animal and look around to make sure its parent is not simply nearby and where possible, place the animal gently back into the nest. Taking the baby away from its parents reduces its chance of survival so the best thing to do is to leave it where it is or return it to the nest. 

If the animal has been orphaned during a road collision, keep yourself safe and ensure you are not in danger of being hit by traffic.

For orphaned animals, reduce stress by planning a quick capture (e.g. throwing a jumper over the animal and scooping it up), keeping handling to a minimum and containing the animal in a dark, quiet place with good ventilation (such as a cardboard box, pet carrier, or wrapped up loosely in a blanket or towel) and keep quiet. Wrap the animal up to keep it warm and contact a nearby wildlife shelter.

For many species of birds, it is not unusual for baby chicks to leave the nest before they are able to fly. Keep any pets away to avoid stress or injury to the animal and watch to see if the bird is struggling or if there are any adult birds watching nearby.

If you see any adult birds hanging around nearby who may be the parents, do not intervene and either leave the baby where it is or if it is a very young bird (fluffy with very few feathers and eyes closed or barely open), gently place it back in the nest. Taking the baby chick away from its parents reduces its chance of survival so the best thing to do is leave where it is or return it to the nest. 

Beware any swooping birds as parents attempt to defend their baby or a nearby nest.

If you do not see any birds which could be the baby chick's parents, or if the animal is lying on its side and looks exhausted, pick it up in a jumper or t-shirt and transfer it to a makeshift 'nest' such as a plastic bowl with soft material or paper towel in it.

23**Frog,Toad,Water Dragon,Crocodile**Unfortunately not much further can be done for this animal. Do not touch or move the animal from where it has been found - frogs can carry an infectious skin disease called chytrid which causes serious illness and death in frogs. Make sure you wash and rinse your hands thoroughly before and after touching a frog, and between handling multiple frogs.  For mass deaths or for further assistance, call the DELWP Customer Service Centre on 136 186.**"Remember the animal is wild and may feel stressed or threatened by your approach - stay quiet and protect the animal from any pets. Frogs sometimes recover from injuries if kept safe from predators, however a frog missing limbs or out in the open during the day may be in trouble. Try placing the frog in the shade under some leaves to see if it recovers or contact a local wildlife shelter for assistance.

Frog skin is very sensitive and can be damaged by the oils and other chemicals on your hands. Use gloves or a clean container to catch the frog or wash and rinse your hands well both before and after touching the frog. Frogs can also carry a disease called chytrid. NEVER touch another frog after handling a sick frog. Wash and rinse your hands well after touching any frog and clean any containers used to catch or store a frog with bleach and rinse with water to remove any chemicals before re-using. Avoid storing frogs together or moving a frog from one location to another as this can also help to spread disease.

Keep the frog in a clean container with a damp cloth or moss in the bottom (not a lot of water - just enough to stay moist) and air holes in the lid until it can be transferred into care.

If you believe you may have found a threatened species or a banana box frog (smooth skin and bright green in colour), please call the Amphibian Research Centre on (03) 9742 3764.**"**Check with Rodney******************"29 -
